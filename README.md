Sign Detection using Machine Learning and Computer Vision

Overview

This project implements a system to detect and interpret sign language using machine learning (ML) and computer vision techniques. The goal is to facilitate communication by converting sign language gestures into text or speech in real-time, enabling seamless interaction between sign language users and non-signers.

Features

Real-Time Detection: Recognizes and interprets sign language gestures in real time.

Scalability: Extendable to include more signs or gestures.

Accuracy: Utilizes advanced ML models for precise detection.

Integration: Compatible with various applications like educational tools, accessibility devices, and communication platforms.

Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

Machine Learning Frameworks: TensorFlow, PyTorch

Computer Vision Libraries: OpenCV, Mediapipe

Dataset: Custom dataset or publicly available sign language datasets like ASL or Indian Sign Language (ISL).

Other Tools: Flask (for backend), React (for frontend), AWS Cloud (for hosting and scalability).

Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/SANKARIYADHAV/sign-detection.git
cd sign-detection

Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

(Optional) Set up a virtual environment:

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

Dataset Preparation

Download or prepare a dataset of sign language gestures.

Organize the dataset into labeled folders for training, validation, and testing.

Update the dataset path in the configuration file (config.yaml).

Usage

Train the model:

python train.py

Test the model:

python test.py

Run the application:

python app.py

Open the browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000 to use the application.

Model Architecture

Preprocessing: Image resizing, normalization, and augmentation.

Feature Extraction: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for gesture recognition.

Classification: Fully connected layers with Softmax for multi-class output.


Future Improvements

Add more sign language gestures to the dataset.

Improve model accuracy with hyperparameter tuning.

Incorporate speech-to-sign and sign-to-speech translation features.

Deploy the model to mobile and web platforms for broader accessibility.
